# plotly-challenge

## Welcome to the plotly challenge. In this assignment, I built plots that display data for bacteria buildup. The page:
* Has a dropdown that allows you to select a specific test subject based on their ID
* Shows the demographic information for the test subject
* Has a bar graph displaying the top 10 bacteria on the test subject
* Has a bubble chart that shows the count for each bacteria (the count is also the weight)

The page can be found [here](https://mmpatterson.github.io/plotly-challenge/Starter_Code/)
